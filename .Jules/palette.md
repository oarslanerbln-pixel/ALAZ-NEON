## 2026-09-17 - Adding ARIA Labels to Language Selectors and Country Selection Options
**Learning:** Icon-only or abbreviation-based interactive elements (like the country flag select and DE/TR/EN buttons) lack screen-reader context for visually impaired users. In multi-lingual apps, explicitly exposing the purpose and state using `aria-label` alongside `aria-pressed` greatly improves navigational confidence.
**Action:** Always add descriptive `aria-label` attributes to abbreviation-based toggle buttons, including dial codes for clarity where appropriate.
